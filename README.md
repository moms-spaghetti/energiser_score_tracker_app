# Energiser Score Tracker

We will be building our first full stack app. It will be a chance to embed everything we've learnt so far and practice breaking down problems into solvable chunks.

## Requirements

- Must use a Database for persistent storage
- Must use the model pattern to allow easy interaction with the data
- Must use an REST API server to manage requests and serve back data
- Must have a front end which allows users to at least view the data

The rest is up to you!
